To test PathFinder implementation (PathFinderSpecializer and DijkstraPathFinderSpecializer involved), I create test file p7example. 

Because I want to test Dijkstra algorithm implementation, I create some tests with graph contains single source. Different cases of destnation are provided as following:
1. as same as source vertex
	=> 為了測試同一個點是否能找到最短路徑
2. different vertex without connecting to source vertex
	=> 為了測試兩個不同但是沒有連接的點，是否不能找到最短路徑
3. some cases of direction edges for different vertex with connecting to source vertex
	=> 為了測試有向圖是否能找到最短路徑
4. different vertices with different cost
	=> 對於不同 cost 的點，測試是否能找到最短路徑
