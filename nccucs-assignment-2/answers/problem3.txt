I create MyGreateTests.java file for Class MyGreatTests

Following are additional test files: p3example1 and p3example2

<p3example1>
To test basic functions, I create file example3.test and example3.expected.
I create a 2-node, 1-edge graph then call the methods listNodes and listChildren to check the data processing.

<p3example2>
In this test, I put all my operations and some other tests into a test file.  
Those other tests were observational cases. I test the operations' performance of object to maximize the ability of functions.
